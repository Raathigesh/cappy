# Cappy

Cappy is an experiment to create a code co-pilot which could help you to code faster by providing tools with rich UI in your favourite editor.

Initial version of Cappy is a vs-code extension and would feature tools to make working with react projects fun and productive.

## What are we trying to solve here?

Let's say you are working on a React JS project, what if the editor could guide you to make you more productive?

What if there is a list of all exported react components and you can just start using it in your current file with a click without worrying about typing the import statement or figuring out the path.

The possiblities are pretty exciting and Cappy is just an experiment on that direction.

This is something I think about very often but it's real now.

## Show me the code

There is code in this repository but it's like very early. I mean, really really early. I'll add more info on this when things fall in place.
